# ETHERD
Real time stream processing platform for the enterprise and the cloud. 

## Goals:
1. Allow users to  easily author long running topologies in any language (or just via UI)
2. Provide SQL like expressive authoring language out of the box
3. Allow users to build complex processing topologies by composing multiple simpler topologies
4. Allow pluggable layers in the execution flow for ingesting components like optimizer.
5. Provider the ability to run topologies at internet scale with auto-scaling, granular resource management and fault tolerance
6. Provide out of the box ability for deployment, upgrade and monitoring/alerting clusters and topologies
7. Out of the box support for connectors to various data sources and sinks
8. Open source and community driven approach.
