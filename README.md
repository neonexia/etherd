# ETHERD
Real time stream processing platform for the enterprise and the cloud. 

## Goals:
1. Allow users to easily author long running topologies in any language (or just via UI)
2. Expressive authoring language out of the box
3. Build complex processing topologies by composing multiple simpler topologies
4. Pluggable architecture for ingesting components like optimizer.
5. Run topologies at internet scale with auto-scaling, granular resource management and fault tolerance
6. Management, debugging and monitoring of topologies
7. Connectors to commonly used cloud and enterprise data sources.
8. Open source and community driven approach.
